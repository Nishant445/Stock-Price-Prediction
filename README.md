# Stock Price Prediction Web Application

This project implements a stock price prediction system as a web application using the Django framework. It predicts stock prices using two different models: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory).
The user can specify the number of days for which they want the stock price prediction, and they can also view fundamental data and news related to the stock.

The stock data is obtained and trained using the yfinance API, and the application allows users to explore the historical stock data and recent news.
